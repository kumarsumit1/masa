service vs resource ?

---------------   VM           -------------------------

virtual machine scale set



---storage ----
storage logging

storage metrics 

Authentic type -- Oauth/SAS

upload .vhd files as page blobs ?

----- Monitroing -- > Log Analytics -----

Note : no blank line in Azure blobs

Azure activity logging

Storage account logs


------ Virtual Network ---
service endpoint 

SKU ?

If we use IPv6 then we will have to use gateway which translates IPv4 requests internally in IPv6 format

Application security group -- region specific ?


VNET peering

Forwarded traffic


VNET Gateway (VPN ) : Scalable
  Vnet to vnet
  point to site 
  site to site
  express Route : External vendor is required
  Virtual WAN
  
remote gateway ?

Note : Focus on the word if it is VNET or Subnet 

If you need to ensure that the private IP address for a resource deployed through the classic deployment model never changes, assign a private IP address with the static method.

IP address was assigned with the static or dynamic allocation method? how to do it

------------ Load balance --------------

Level 4 load balancer
  two types -- difference important

Application GAteway

----- Service fabric App ------------------

Guest executables : no benefits of service is not coupled with service fabric
Reliable services : It a framework by MS, whose API needs to be called to execute the service, it has Lock in , 
						Two types : stateless , Statefull ( using reliable collection )
Reliable Actors : It works on messages, 

ASF is Microsoft's alternative to AKS

---------------  secure data solution -------------------
TDE ( transparent data encryption ) :
	BYOK ( bring your key ) option is available where user can bring their own kye and sotre in Azure kye vault and SQL server will use it from there

	When data is exported then it is not encrypted and is available in format BACPAC

Azure Storage Encryption :
	it is enable by default and cannot be disabled
	

Azure Key Vault :
	place for storing secrets and certificates , access key , passwords
	
	
---------- Cosmos DB ------------------------------
Cosmos DB is fully distributed multi node DB service .
It exposes Mongo, casssandra DB etc


Consistency Level
	strong : Reads are gurantedd to see most writes
	
	bounded staleness : Here you can define the delay, minimum being 5 sec , Used in pub/sub, queue, stock ticker
	session : Each session will be consitent and data will eventually get written to other nodes not part of same session
	consistent prefix : Oder of operation is gurantedd but there will be some delay
	eventual : No gurarantee in which data comes to system, for eg . retweets,like etc 
	
	
Cross partition Query :
    by default it is enabled, so if you fire a query it checks data availablity in all partitions, so it can be costly at times
    So if you disable this feature then you need to make sure which partiotion you re searching the data for.
